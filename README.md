# bottleneck
Code is from the rotation project "solution space in behavioral control" and are based on the code from the paper "Modeling bottlenecks, modularity, and context-dependency in behavioral control" written by Veronika Dubinkina, Anjalika Nande, Riccardo Ravasio and Grace Zhang. The original code and instruction can be found at https://github.com/drahcir7/bottleneck-behaviors.

# Run the simulation with fixed behavioral matrix
When running the fixed behavioral matrix, run the nn_bottleneck.py together with a behavioral matrix file command.csv in the working directory.
